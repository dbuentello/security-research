This repository documents security research of a *certain individual*.

Here, threshold for what is considered a security issue is intentionally very low.

Security-related tools are hosted separately:

* longutf8_, an overlong UTF-8 sequence generator
* python-afl_, which enables `American fuzzy lop`_ instrumentation of Python code
* `directory traversal samples`_
